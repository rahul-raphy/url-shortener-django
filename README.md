# url-shortener-django

URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web that enables the Uniform Resource Locator to be made considerably shorter and still direct to the desired page. This is done by using a redirect path to a web page that has a long URL.

The project is developed using Django for backend and HTML and CSS for frontend.

Working: When the user enters the link, a short link will appear. Use clipboard emote to copy the link. The link will redirect you to the original link.
